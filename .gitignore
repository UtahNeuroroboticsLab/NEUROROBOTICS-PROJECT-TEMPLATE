# Add the paths to files or folders you want to ignore to this file
# For example, to ignore all .log files:
#   *.log
# To ignore a specific folder:
#   /path/to/folder/
# To ignore a specific file:
#   /path/to/file.txt
# You can also use comments to explain why certain files are ignored
# For example:
#   Ignore temporary files generated by the IDE
#   *.tmp
